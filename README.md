# GURPSCombatHelper
Some day, this program will allow users to wave away most of the "boilerplate" of the GURPS combat system. Right now, though, it just displays a pretty form.

Or at least it did. I finally added the ability to calculate thrown objects (i.e: how far you can toss, and for what amount of damage). Starting work on getting some sort of PC/NPC (I call them "Actors", internally) model so that people can use this to test out actual combat.
